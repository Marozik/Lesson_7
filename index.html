                        class="jordan">Michael
                        Jordan</a>. Over 15 seasons in the NBA, Mike catapulted the sport back into popularity after the
                     heyday of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson came to close. Armed with a trademark flair, style and
                     tongue-out cockiness, MJ was an instant star and fans recognised it. Droves of people travelled
                     across
                     the continent to catch a glimpse of the Chicago Bulls’ number 23 in action and it was always a
                     spectacle. Everyone remembers where they were when Jordan hit that shot in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA
                     Finals. Similarly, they remember the first time they witnessed Air Jordan dunk from the free thrown
                     line. Or maybe it was the time he joined a band of misfit players to defeat a team of genetically
                     modified alien beings to save Earth from complete annihilation. There truly is nothing Michael
                     Jordan
                     hasn’t achieved on the court.
                  </p>
                  <p class="about-jordan">
                     But it is his appeal off it that is most notable. Even now, more than 15 years after he retired
                     (for
                     the third time no less), Michael Jordan’s legacy remains unequalled. His GOAT status was confirmed
                     when the ESPN documentary The Last Dance premiered. Where more than 6.1 million viewers tuned in to
                     episode 1 and 2 to see Jordan tell the story of his incredible career, making it the most
                     successful
                     documentary in the network’s history. And while MJ is certainly the leader of the series, some
                     colourful co-stars threatened to steal the limelight. No, not Charles Oakley or Dennis Rodman, but
                     a
                     slew of castmates that offer more than their fair share of eye-catching moments; his shoes. Or more
                     accurately, his Air Jordans.

                  Air Jordan History
               </h2>
               <p class="about-history">
                  Way back in 1985, before he was the greatest, Michael Jordan was a skinny kid from the University of
                  North Carolina. Taken pick three in that year’s draft, Jordan was expected to produce big things, both
                  on and off the court. He signed a five-year endorsement deal with Nike, worth reportedly $2.5 million
                  (plus royalties). While it sounds like peanuts compared to the monstrous paychecks athletes receive
                  now, it bears reminding that this was 1985 and the player in question had yet to play a game, let
                  alone prove his worth. But this was no ordinary rookie.
               </p>
               <p class="about-history">
                  Over the course of the season, Mike dominated, finishing as the Rookie of the Year, but amongst the
                  fans, he was MVP. His signature tongue-out play style and youthful arrogance was the perfect blend of
                  Johnson’s speed and athleticism and Bird’s skill and shooting, all wrapped up in a stylish package.
                  Nike’s Peter Moore was responsible for the new kid’s kicks and much like the rookie himself, they
                  didn’t disappoint. The first Jordan shoes, aptly named the Air Jordan 1 was as visually stunning as
                  they were ground-breaking. And to this day, they remain one of the most popular Jordans ever.
               </p>
               <p class="about-history">
                  The first in the series to feature the familiar Nike Swoosh logo. And predating the Jumpman logo, the
                  OG shoe featured the Wings logo – a basketball with wings stretching from both sides and “Air Jordan”
                  printed above the ball. Basketball folklore will tell you that the Jordan 1 was originally banned by
                  the NBA, but that’s not entirely true. A prototype Red and Black Air colourway, known as the Nike Air
                  Ship was banned by NBA commissioner David Stern for breaching the ’51 per cent rule’, which dictated
                  that footwear must be majority white.
               </p>
               <p class="about-history">
                  The popular story is that the ban and subsequent $5,000 per game fine didn’t stop MJ from wearing the
                  Air Jordan 1 on-court. Nike recognised the unique marketing opportunity, opting to pay the fine for
                  each time Michael Jordan wore the shoes in-game. Thus, the bad boy, a rule-breaking ethos of the Air
                  Jordans was born.

                  Following the unprecedented success of the first shoe, Nike was faced with a challenge to back it up.
                  The Air Jordan II was released in 1986, however, it was in 1988 that Air Jordans got their own real

               <p class="about-design">
                  The best Air Jordans all share common design elements, most of which come from long-time collaborator

                  midsole, and pine green outsole complete this design.
